# EndStock Project Description

## Overview
A Vue.js-based web application that provides real-time stock investment recommendations using a hybrid approach of machine learning and technical analysis. The application combines historical data training with real-time market data to deliver up-to-the-minute investment insights.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Machine Learning Component
- Training based on comprehensive stock market dataset (1962-2024)
- Feature engineering incorporating technical indicators and market patterns
- Model conversion to TensorFlow.js for browser-based execution
- Regular model retraining to adapt to market changes

### 2. Real-Time Analysis
- Integration with financial APIs (Alpha Vantage/Yahoo Finance)
- Live technical indicator calculations
- Browser-based scoring system
- Intelligent caching and rate limiting

### 3. Frontend Stack
- Vue.js for UI components
- TensorFlow.js for model execution
- Technical analysis libraries
- Chart.js for data visualization
- TailwindCSS for styling
